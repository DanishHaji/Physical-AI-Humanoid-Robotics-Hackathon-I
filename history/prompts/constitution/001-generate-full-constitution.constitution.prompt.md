## Prompt

/sp.constitution

Project Name:
Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — The Complete AI-Native Textbook

Purpose:
Create a deeply detailed, modern, AI-native textbook that teaches the full Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.
The book will be authored using Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus and published with a creative, futuristic Docusaurus theme.
It must integrate a context-aware RAG chatbot that answers only from selected or available chapter text.
The textbook will follow both Module-based and Week-based learning flows, guiding students from fundamentals to a complete humanoid robotics capstone.

Scope:
- Full AI-native, multi-chapter textbook with:
  • 4 Major Modules (based on course structure)
  • 13 Week-by-Week sub-chapters (embedded inside modules)
  • Deeper technical details, diagrams (AI-generated), examples, and code snippets
  • Multi-modal explanation style (theory, workflow, code, diagrams)
- UI will use a new, creative theme (not Panaversity default)
- Docusaurus sidebar-embedded chatbot
- Free-tier compatible RAG backend using:
  • FastAPI
  • OpenAI Agents / ChatKit SDK
  • Neon Serverless Postgres
  • Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier)
- Full integration with Claude Code for writing & refining chapters
- Optional bonus features:
  • Urdu Translation (per chapter)
  • Personalize-Chapter button based on user's hardware/software background
  • Reusable Intelligence: Claude Subagents + Agent Skills

Core Principles:
- AI-Native Writing (Claude-first content generation)
- Logical Pedagogy (Modules → Weeks → Capstone)
- Maximum Detail & Technical Depth
- Creative Visual + Technical Theme
- Accurate robotics knowledge aligned with ROS 2, Isaac, Gazebo
- Smooth navigation using Docusaurus sidebar structure
- RAG chatbot answers strictly from the book
- Scalable architecture using free or affordable cloud tools

Key Features:
- Docusaurus textbook with a custom creative theme
- Embedded RAG chatbot in the sidebar
- "Select text → Ask AI" contextual answering
- Detailed module + week breakdown:
  Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System
  Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo + Unity)
  Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain
  Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
  Week 1–13 flow inside modules
- Detailed Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Robot Pipeline
- Hardware lab guide (Workstations, Jetson, RealSense, Unitree robots)
- Sim-to-Real workflows
- Appendices for code, architecture, and troubleshooting

Constraints:
- Must run on GitHub Pages (static site)
- RAG must operate on free-tier cloud services
- Embeddings must remain lightweight for cost control
- GPU-based processes only described, not executed on server
- Chatbot cannot hallucinate or answer outside book text
- Theme must remain responsive, clean, and visually attractive

Success Criteria:
- Successful Docusaurus build + GitHub Pages deployment
- 100% working sidebar-embedded RAG chatbot
- Accurate answers using ONLY book text
- Beautiful, modern, creative UI/UX with smooth animations
- Full module + week content completed and generated by Claude
- Bonus features implemented (Urdu translation + personalization)
- Reusable Claude Subagents & Skills incorporated
- Complete, production-quality AI-native textbook

Outputs Expected from Spec-Kit Plus:
- Stable project structure
- Fully generated book folders & chapter templates
- RAG backend scaffolding (FastAPI + Qdrant + Neon)
- Configurations for Docusaurus theme customization
- Plan + tasks for Claude-driven chapter writing
- Implementation workflow for personalization & Urdu features

Generate full constitution.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics AI-Native Textbook project with the following key sections:

**Core Principles** (7 principles):
1. AI-Native Content Generation - Claude-first authorship with iterative refinement
2. Pedagogical Architecture - Module-Week dual structure (4 modules, 13 weeks)
3. Technical Depth & Accuracy - Maximum detail with multi-modal content
4. RAG Chatbot Integration - Context-aware, hallucination-free answering
5. Creative & Modern UI/UX - Futuristic Docusaurus theme customization
6. Free-Tier Infrastructure Constraint - Qdrant, Neon, GitHub Pages optimization
7. Reusability & Extensibility - Claude subagents and template-driven content

**Content Standards**:
- Mandatory 10-section chapter structure
- Code quality standards (executable, tested, documented)
- Diagram standards (Mermaid preferred, accessibility required)

**Technical Architecture**:
- Complete repository structure defined
- RAG backend architecture (FastAPI + Qdrant + Neon + OpenAI)
- Docusaurus configuration with custom theme specs
- Security and performance requirements

**Development Workflow**:
- 7-step chapter writing process (spec → plan → tasks → implementation → review → RAG indexing → PHR)
- Git workflow with branch strategy and commit standards
- PR requirements and review process

**Quality Gates**:
- Chapter acceptance criteria (completeness, accuracy, pedagogy, formatting)
- RAG system acceptance criteria (retrieval quality, performance, reliability)

**Constraints & Non-Goals**:
- Technical constraints (static site, free-tier, no GPU on server)
- Content scope (in/out of scope clearly defined)

**Bonus Features**:
- Urdu translation with RTL support
- Personalize-Chapter button for user customization
- Progress tracking system

**Governance**:
- Constitution authority and amendment process
- Compliance enforcement checklist
- Conflict resolution priority order

**Success Metrics**:
- Textbook quality (4 modules, 13 weeks, 100+ diagrams, 200+ code examples)
- RAG chatbot (>90% accuracy, <3s response time)
- User experience (Lighthouse >90, mobile responsive)
- Deployment (GitHub Pages, HTTPS, SEO)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive constitution established (614 lines) covering all aspects of the AI-native textbook project, including technical architecture, development workflow, quality standards, and governance
- 🧪 Tests: None (constitution document, no executable code)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md with complete project principles and guidelines
- 🔁 Next prompts:
  - Create chapter template (.specify/templates/chapter-template.md)
  - Initialize Docusaurus project structure
  - Set up RAG backend scaffolding (specs/rag-chatbot/)
  - Create first module/chapter spec (specs/chapter-week-01-introduction/)
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully captures the ambitious scope of creating an AI-native textbook with integrated RAG chatbot, while maintaining practical constraints (free-tier infrastructure, static site deployment). The dual Module-Week structure provides both topic-based and timeline-based learning flows. Key innovation areas: Claude subagents for content generation, context-aware chatbot, and personalization features.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None during constitution creation. Potential risks: scope creep (bonus features), free-tier limitations (Qdrant 1GB, Neon 0.5GB), maintaining technical accuracy across 13 chapters
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Manual review - PASS. Constitution covers all required aspects per Spec-Kit Plus guidelines: core principles, technical architecture, workflow, quality gates, governance
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard /sp.constitution command with detailed project context provided
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Create chapter template next to establish reusable content structure, ensuring consistency across all 13 weekly chapters
