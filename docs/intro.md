# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**The Complete AI-Native Textbook - From ROS 2 to Vision-Language-Action Systems**

Created by **Danish** | Panaversity AI-100 Course

## 🤖 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of embodied intelligence, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in software, Physical AI enables machines to perceive, understand, and interact with the physical world through sensors, actuators, and intelligent control systems.

This textbook takes you on a comprehensive journey from fundamental robotics concepts to cutting-edge Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems powering the next generation of humanoid robots.

## 📚 Course Structure

This textbook is organized into **4 major modules** plus a **capstone integration project**:

### Module 1: ROS 2 Nervous System
Learn the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) - the de facto standard for robotic applications. Master nodes, topics, services, URDF, and build your first humanoid robot controller.

- **Chapter 1**: Physical AI Introduction & Foundations
- **Chapter 2**: ROS 2 Fundamentals (Nodes, Topics, Services, URDF, TF2)

### Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation
Create photorealistic simulations of robots using Gazebo Harmonic and Unity ML-Agents. Learn sim-to-real transfer techniques and domain randomization.

- **Chapter 3**: Gazebo & Unity Simulation Workflows

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac AI Brain
Harness GPU-accelerated robotics simulation with Isaac Sim and reinforcement learning with Isaac Lab. Train humanoid robots in photorealistic environments.

- **Chapter 4**: Isaac Sim Platform & Isaac Lab for Humanoid RL

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrate computer vision, large language models, and action planning to build robots that understand language commands and execute complex tasks.

- **Chapter 5**: VLA Systems (Vision + Language → Action)

### Capstone Integration Project
Build a complete autonomous humanoid robot system integrating everything you've learned: voice commands → planning → navigation → object manipulation.

- **Chapter 6**: End-to-End Physical AI System
